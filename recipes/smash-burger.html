			<h2>Description</h2>
			<div class="description">
				<p>
					Pressed onto a sizzling hot griddle or skillet, smash
					burgers are easy to make and <em>loaded with flavor</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
					See, by placing a ball of meat on a hot, unoiled griddle and
					smashing it down firmly into a flat, thin disk, you greatly
					increase the contact points between the meat and the
					griddle, which in turn increases the
					<em>Maillard reaction</em>. That's the series of chemical
					reactions that create the rich brown crust that makes our
					steaks and burgers taste so freaking good.

			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
				<li>
					Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise,
					mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles
				</li>
				<li>
					4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two
					2-ounce (55g) balls
				</li>
				<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
				<li>
					1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or
					homemade melting cheese
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun.
					Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.
				</li>
				<li>
					Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over
					high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and
					smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second
					spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly
					wider than burger bun.
				</li>
				<li>
					Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook
					until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to
					turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a
					bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula,
					carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of
					the browned bits.
				</li>
				<li>
					Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1
					patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately
					remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.
				</li>
